# Built-In Algorithms

## Description
- Visualised the algorithmic complexity of common data structures & algorithms I implmented in Java. With graphs which show how fast a given algorithms runtime is as the size of the input (number of operations) gets larger.

### Last
- Given an array, return the last element

### Reverse
- Given an array return the array in reverse.

### Shuffle
- Given an array, shuffle the array.
