# Built-In Algorithms

## Project Description

What the application does:
- Visualised the algorithmic complexity of common data structures & algorithms I implmented in Java. With graphs which show how fast a given algorithms runtime is as the size of the input (number of operations) gets larger.

### Last
- Given an array, return the last element
- Graphs:
